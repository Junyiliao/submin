-------------------

    see http://supermind.nl/submin/download.html


Installing from source:

    Download tarball from http://supermind.nl/submin/download.html
    Extract the tarball
    execute: python setup.py install
    => submin will be installed in site-packages, an executable submin-admin
       will be installed in /usr/bin


Create submin environment
-------------------------

Multiple submin installations can co-exist on the same server. Therefore, for
each installation, an environment must be created. All data (repositories,
configuration, etc) are located in one directory, for example /var/lib/submin.

To create a submin environment, follow instructions after executing:

    submin-admin /var/lib/submin initenv

For help on submin-admin, execute the following command:

    submin-admin <anything> help
