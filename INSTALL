Submin Installation
-------------------

When installing from tarball, please run:

  python bin/install.py <installdir>

  (Use the '--help' option to get more options)

To install submin in /usr/local, fill in /usr/local for <installdir>. You can
then run /usr/local/bin/submin-admin to create your submin project (multiple
seperate projects are possible). This program will show some help, but for a
quick start, just run:

  /usr/local/bin/submin-admin create default

and it will create files in /etc/submin, /var/lib/submin. Please note that
you have to include one of the generated apache files in /etc/submin/ to your
apache2 config. You can use the "Include" directive for that if you want
to include it in only a specific virtual host.

Then restart apache, go to http://[your webserver]/submin, and log in as user
admin with password admin.

If any instructions are not clear, please file a bug (see 'development' on the
website).
