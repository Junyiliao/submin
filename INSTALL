Submin Installation
-------------------

Installing from debian package: 

    see http://supermind.nl/submin/download.html


Installing from source:

    Download tarball from http://supermind.nl/submin/download.html
    Extract the tarball
    execute: python setup.py install
    => submin will be installed in site-packages, an executable submin2-admin
       will be installed in /usr/bin


Create submin environment
-------------------------

Multiple submin installations can co-exist on the same server. Therefore, for
each installation, an environment must be created. All data (repositories,
configuration, etc) are located in one directory, for example /var/lib/submin.

To create a submin environment, follow instructions after executing:

    submin2-admin /var/lib/submin initenv your@email.address

For help on submin-admin, execute the following command:

    submin2-admin <anything> help
    submin2-admin <anything> help <subcommand>


Git support (optional)
----------------------

Git support requires a special user to be created and some additional settings.
Run the following command as root and follow the instructions:

    submin2-admin /var/lib/submin git init


Configure Apache2 Webserver
---------------------------

Submin2 can create all kinds of configs for you, to create all different kinds
of Apache config files, run the following command (this is already done if you
have run initenv):

    submin2-admin /var/lib/submin apacheconf create all /var/lib/submin/conf/apache.conf

Now to activate the submin2 website, the configuration should be included into
Apache2. To use for example CGI and SVN, execute the following commands as
root (on Debian systems):

    ln -s /var/lib/submin/conf/apache-webui-cgi.conf /etc/apache2/conf.d/
    ln -s /var/lib/submin/conf/apache-svn.conf /etc/apache2/conf.d/

Now restart your webserver to activate the new settings.

    apachectl restart


Login to your Submin2 website
-----------------------------

The email-address you have provided with the 'initenv' command above has
received a password reset email. Read your email and click the link. You will
get another email with the password. You can use this to login.

Happy subminning :)
